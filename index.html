<h2>
	Background</h2>
<p>
	Pyrmont Action was formed in 2003 by a group of residents who had come together to campaign for improved broadband infrastructure for Pyrmont. Most of us were new to Pyrmont, a suburb undergoing dramatic redevelopment and there was a need for an organization to follow up on issues raised at local City of Sydney forums. A Steering Committee was established to develop our constitution and this was endorsed at the Inaugural General Meeting held on 15 July, 2003 which was attended by over 40 local residents.<br />
	<br />
	The group incorporated on 29 November, 2005 under the NSW Associations Incorporation Act 1984. Constitution<br />
	<br />
